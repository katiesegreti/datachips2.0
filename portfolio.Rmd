I'm mainly focusing on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) now, but I've created a lot of work using other technologies too. Here is a sample.

## Interactive quarterly report
This is a sample report created with **AMcharts JS**.

## Direwolves and Starks
View my interactive Game of Thrones chart, made wtih **svg.js** and **jQuery**. Spoiler Alert: it details the Stark kids (including Jon Snow) and their connections to their Direwolves.

## Graphics made with Illustrator
Here are some graphics I made using **Adobe Illustrator**. Some were for work, some for fun. Some are gifs, some are static jpgs.
