<h2>Perler bead patterns</h2>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is creating pixel art with perler beads. To get the patterns, I usually search for pixelated images on pinterest. But I’ve always wanted to create my <em>own</em> pixelated images too!</p>
<p>I found this quad-ruled boombox notebook at TJMaxx recently and it inspired me to design my own pixel boombox.</p>

<h2>Mets logo</h2>
<p>Although it is often painful, I am a fan of the New York Mets. I searched a while back for a pixelated NY Mets logo but couldn’t find one. So I figured that was a good image to start trying to pixelate.</p>
<div id="adobe-illustrator" class="section level3">
<h3>Adobe Illustrator</h3>
<p>I’ve used Adobe Illustrator a lot for making graphics and I’m much more comfortable using that than Photoshop. So that’s where I’m starting.</p>
<p>I found a basic blue and orange NY logo in the Mets font and placed it in an Illustrator file. Then highlighted the image and went to <code>Effect -&gt; Pixelate -&gt; Color Halftone...</code> which brought up a dialog box:</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Right now I’m just exploring and having fun so I just put in some numbers without doing any research. The results are actually really fun!</p>

<p>I’m going to try to use this for a perler bead pattern! It may or may not work, but this was fun so far.</p>
