## Perler bead patterns
One of my favorite hobbies is creating pixel art with perler beads. To get the patterns, I usually search for pixelated images on pinterest. But I've always wanted to create my *own* pixelated images too!

I found this quad-ruled boombox notebook at TJMaxx recently and it inspired me to design my own pixel boombox.

## Mets logo
Although it is often painful, I am a fan of the New York Mets. I searched a while back for a pixelated NY Mets logo but couldn't find one. So I figured that was a good image to start trying to pixelate.

### Adobe Illustrator
I've used Adobe Illustrator a lot for making graphics and I'm much more comfortable using that than Photoshop. So that's where I'm starting.

I found a basic blue and orange NY logo in the Mets font and placed it in an Illustrator file. Then highlighted the image and went to `Effect -> Pixelate -> Color Halftone...` which brought up a dialog box:

Right now I'm just exploring and having fun so I just put in some numbers without doing any research. The results are actually really fun!

I'm going to try to use this for a perler bead pattern! It may or may not work, but this was fun so far.
