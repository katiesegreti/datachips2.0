<p>I’m mainly focusing on <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> now, but I’ve created a lot of work using other technologies too. Here is a sample.</p>
<div id="interactive-quarterly-report" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactive quarterly report</h2>
<p>This is a sample report created with <strong>AMcharts JS</strong>. <a href="chartsample.html"><img src="/img/amcharts.png" alt="report" style="height: 300px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<div id="direwolves-and-starks" class="section level2">
<h2>Direwolves and Starks</h2>
<p>View my interactive Game of Thrones chart, made wtih <strong>svg.js</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>. Spoiler Alert: it details the Stark kids (including Jon Snow) and their connections to their Direwolves.</p>
<p><a href="direwolves.html"><img src="/img/direwolves.png" alt="direwolves" style="height: 450px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<div id="graphics-made-with-illustrator" class="section level2">
<h2>Graphics made with Illustrator</h2>
<p>Here are some graphics I made using <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>. Some were for work, some for fun. Some are gifs, some are static jpgs.</p>
<p><a href="graphics.html"><img src="/img/jon-snow-women.jpg" alt="direwolves" style="height: 300px;"/></a></p>
</div>
